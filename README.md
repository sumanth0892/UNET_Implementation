# UNET_Implementation
Implementing UNET from scratch in Python
This repository contains the UNET architecture used in Biomedical imaging implemented from scratch in Python.
The implemetation is divided into:
  Left Vertex -> The left portion of the architecture
  Right Vertex -> The right portion of the architecture
  Last convolution -> The last set batch of convolutions before the output map is created
  Image_cropper -> Snippet to get the images to the correct size before concatenating.
